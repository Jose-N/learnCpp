# Lesson Notes

* Not using an IDE using neovim so the setup for using C++ is a little more complicated
* Installed LSP via mason for C++ (clangd)
* Installed GCC via Arch Repo
* Std Libraries need to be linked when using `gcc` command
* `g++` is already on my machine this automatically links the stdlibrary and math.h library
* Need to read/learn about cmake and gcc
